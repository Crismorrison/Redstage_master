## 2. After Instalation..
- Dont forget :
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento cache:clean
php bin/magento cache:flush

Every time you add a banner or edit a banner flush cache is needed.
This is a 0.0.1 Version, I can improve a lot with more functions like choose place to post the banner, add as widget... etc... I made this Module un 1 day.. today November 19 2018 working from 7am to 6pm.
